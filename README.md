# Fortnite Tournament

A GUI-based JavaFX application that partitions a list of players into 16 balanced teams for a gaming tournament

# Features 
- 16 Teams are generated using a simple algorithm that ensures the average rating is roughly the same for all teams
- Players are added to an array-based List that allows for adding, removing, and sorting by name or rating 
- Reads the list of players from a comma-separated file at program start-up, then stores in an appropriate data structure during runtime
- Uses the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern to develop the user interface and separating it from the program logic
